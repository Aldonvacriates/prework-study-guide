# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created to help new developers get started with essential web development technologies including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project aims to provide a comprehensive study resource that addresses the basics of these technologies, offering both theoretical knowledge and practical examples.

Motivation: To create a foundational guide for prework that assists new developers in understanding and practicing the basics of web development.
Why: This project was built to provide a structured, easy-to-follow resource for beginners to use before starting more advanced coursework or projects.
Problem: It solves the issue of having scattered or overwhelming information by consolidating key concepts into a single, organized guide.
Learning: Throughout the project, the importance of structuring information clearly and providing practical examples alongside theoretical content was emphasized.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
